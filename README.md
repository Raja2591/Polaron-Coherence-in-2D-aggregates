    Charge Modulation Spectra in 2D aggregates


    This program calculates the charge modulation spectra for a 2 dimensional
    aggregate. It is able to run over multiple processors using MPI, Slepc and Petsc, allowing
    for larger system sizes in less time. 
    
    The makefile is attached for compilation.
