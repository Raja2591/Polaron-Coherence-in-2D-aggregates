What is it?
-----------

This program calculates the Charge Modulation Spectrum in the near IR and the mid-IR region for a 2 Dimensional molecular aggregate by solving the disordered Holstein molecular crystal Hamiltonian using a multiparticle basis set. An introduction of the Holstein Hamiltonian and the For elaborate details regarding the theory please go through the following papers:
