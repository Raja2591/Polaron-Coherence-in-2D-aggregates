What is it?
-----------

This program calculates the Charge Modulation Spectrum in the near IR and the mid-IR region for a 2 Dimensional molecular aggregate by solving the Holstein molecular crystal Hamiltonian using a multiparticle basis set. For elaborate details regarding the theory please go through the following papers:

    Charge Modulation Spectra in 2 dimensional aggregates


    This program calculates the Charge Modulation Spectra for a 2 Dimensional polymer
    aggregate. It is able to run over multiple processors using MPI, Slepc and Petsc, allowing
    for larger system sizes in less time. 
    
    The makefile is attached for compilation.
