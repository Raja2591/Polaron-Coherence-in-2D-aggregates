    Charge Modulation Spectra in 2 dimensional aggregates


    This program calculates the Charge Modulation Spectra for a 2 Dimensional polymer
    aggregate. It is able to run over multiple processors using MPI, Slepc and Petsc, allowing
    for larger system sizes in less time. 
    
    The makefile is attached for compilation.
