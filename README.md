What is it?
-----------

This program calculates the Charge Modulation Spectrum in the near IR and the mid-IR region for a 2 Dimensional molecular aggregate by solving the disordered Holstein Hamiltonian employing a multiparticle basis set. 

Modelling Disorder in Polymer Aggregates
----------------------------------------

Energetic disorder in polymer films arises from variations in nearest neighbor packing distances, change in intramolecular torsional angles and the presence of spatially fluctuating electric fields. We introduce various kinds of diagonal and offdiagonal disorder. Please look into the reference mentioned below for the disorder models that have been used in the code. 


Polaron Absorption and Coherence 
----------------------------------------

We focus our attention entirely on the far to mid-IR transitions between the polaron ground state, lowest eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian and all the excited polaron states. We have developed a relation between polaron coherence and polaron absorption spectra. To put it simply, given an absorption spectrum, we can extract the polaron delocalization lengths both along the polymer backbone and in between chains. The subroutine to calculate the polaron absorption and coherence has been included in the repository. Please have a look.

MPI  
----

The polaron absorption spectrum need to be averaged over several thousand configurations to obtain absolute convergence. The code uses MPI to parallely run the disorder configurations over multiple processors.
